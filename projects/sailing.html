<!--SUMMARY-->
<div class="content">
	<p>
		You are a sailor looking for your brother on an old and forgotten island somewhere in the Bering sea. You
		were
		supposed to meet up after dropping them off a month ago. But due to the harsh weather conditions, your ship
		has
		been damaged trying to dock. You'll need to repair your boat to survive the harsh weather conditions and
		wildlife of Alaska. By using the Journal that was left behind you're able to trace your brother's steps on
		the
		islands and find out where they might be locatedâ€¦
	</p>

	<p>
		The Archipelago Promise is a single-player open-world survival game in which you explore different islands
		to
		find your lost brother. You collect supplies on the different islands to survive the Harsh Alaskan
		Environment
		and protect yourself from dangerous wildlife.
	</p>

	<p>
		By exploring the different islands you are able to locate your lost brother using old scraps that were left
		behind as well as the notes he wrote in your Journal.
