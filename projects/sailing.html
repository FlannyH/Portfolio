	<div class="content">
		<p>
			You are a sailor looking for your brother on an old and forgotten island somewhere in the Bering sea. You
			were
			supposed to meet up after dropping them off a month ago. But due to the harsh weather conditions, your ship
			has
			been damaged trying to dock. Youâ€™ll need to repair your boat to survive the harsh weather conditions and
			wildlife of Alaska. By using the Journal that was left behind youâ€™re able to trace your brotherâ€™s steps on
			the
			islands and find out where they might be locatedâ€¦
		</p>

		<p>
			The Archipelago Promise is a single-player open-world survival game in which you explore different islands
			to
			find your lost brother. You collect supplies on the different islands to survive the Harsh Alaskan
			Environment
			and protect yourself from dangerous wildlife.
		</p>

		<p>
			By exploring the different islands you are able to locate your lost brother using old scraps that were left
			behind as well as the notes he wrote in your Journal.
