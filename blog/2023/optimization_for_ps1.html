	<p>Optimizing for Playstation 1</p>

<!--INTRO-->
<div class="content">
	<p> 
        For the past year, I've been learning how to program games for the Playstation 1 in my spare time, using PSn00bSDK, an open source homebrew SDK for the Playstation 1, using the C programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
        This adventure started as a <a href="">silly tweet of a spinning low-poly rat with the Free Bird solo playing in the background</a>, but quickly got out of hand, and grew into an ambitious port of Sub Nivis, a game I worked on at Breda University of Applied Science.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the project progressed, I ran into problems with the game's performance, because of how many polygons the game was rendering. So, to get the performance to at least 30 fps, I had to optimize the game. In this page I will explain what I've done to keep the performance of the game up to standard.

        For some added context: technically speaking, the Playstation 1's GPU only renders triangles. However, its GPU <i>does</i> have a render command packet for rendering quads, it just splits it into 2 triangles internally. Despite that, it's still beneficial to render quads whenever possible.
    </p>
	<p> 
        Initially, the game only used triangles in the model data. This is the easiest way to implement 3D geometry, since modern graphics are all triangle-based anyway. Some formats, like glTF, don't even support other primitive types than triangles.
    </p>
    <p>
        My model format does not use index buffers, as it created too much overhead for the rendering code. This means that a quad would be represented as two triangles, so every quad would require 6 vertices. If we add support for quads in the model format, we reduce the number of vertices needed for each quad to only 4. This saves 2 vertex transformations per quad, effectively removing up to a third of our vertex processing time. If we consider the fact that most 3D-modeling workflows are quad-based, this optimization has a significant impact on the game's performance.
